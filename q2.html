        <h1>How the Action attribute works</h1>
        <h2>... in my own words</h2>
        <p> The responsibility of the action attributes of a form tag basically assist with the submission process, so the form data is presented when a user presses the "submit button." It illustrates the area where the form data is dispatched to process the site.</p>
